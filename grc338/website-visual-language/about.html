                    <p>
                     Corazón de Pan was born from a simple belief: that the sweetest moments in life are the ones we share.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                     The bakery’s founder, Isaiah Luna, grew up waking to the smell of fresh conchas and bolillos drifting through 
                     their grandmother’s kitchen. Every morning, Abuela Rosa would knead dough by hand, humming softly as she sprinkled 
                     sugar over her famous pan dulce. She always said the secret ingredient wasn’t in the recipe — it was in the corazón 
                     you put into every batch.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Years later, after moving away from home and realizing how deeply those flavors were tied to family, 
                        comfort, and culture, Isaiah decided to bring that sense of warmth to the community. What started as 
                        weekend baking for friends turned into a dream: a bakery that celebrated tradition while welcoming 
                        everyone like family.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2025, Corazón de Pan opened its doors for the first time. The goal was never just to sell 
                        pastries — it was to create a space filled with aroma, nostalgia, and connection. 
                        Every piece of pan dulce is crafted with care, inspired by Abuela’s recipes yet infused with 
                        modern creativity. From colorful conchas to seasonal specialties, every pastry carries a story.
                    </p>
                    <p>Corazón de Pan remains dedicated to honoring the past while baking a sweeter future. 
                        We hope that with every bite, you feel the same comfort, joy, and love that first inspired this 
                        bakery — because here, everything truly comes from the heart.
