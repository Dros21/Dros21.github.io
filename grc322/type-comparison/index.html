             <h2>History of each typeface</h2>

			 <h3><span class="Univers-typeface">Univers Next</span></h3> <!-- Older typeface first, please. -->
             <p>Univers Next is a neo-grotesque sans serif typeface created by Adrian Frutiger in 1957 during the post war boom of the Swiss style.

Some key design characteristics include: a uniform stroke weights, tight spacing, and a large type family with 20+ different styles. Univers is a typeface that was created to demonstrate Swiss modernism, function primarily across print and provide designers with a numbered classification system. Overall, Univers is a legible, neutral and versatile typeface that can be used broadly.</p>

					alt="A comparison of the uppercase 'Y' in both the Univers Next and Acumin. An overlapped version of the two characters are also shown.">
				<figcaption>Besides the height difference at 100 pt, the two characters seem pretty similar.
